# Getting Started

Poll application

Backend API is provided by Polls API : https://pollsapi.docs.apiary.io/

Boilerplate based on React Next Boilerplate : https://github.com/react-next-boilerplate/react-next-boilerplate

## System Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10 or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies .
2. Run `npm run dev` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs `next` which starts Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Runs `next` build which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs `next` start which starts a Next.js production server

Now you're ready to rumble! :traffic_light:
